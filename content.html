        <p>1. Bengal Tiger <br> 
          Bengal tigers account for about half of the world’s total tiger population, 70% of which can be found living in India. Though this big cat is an adaptable animal that can live in various habitats including forests, mangroves and wetlands, and has the ability to cope with hot or cold temperatures, Bengal tiger populations have plummeted over the years. The animal has been endangered following decades of persistent poaching for its skin and body parts, trophy hunting, and severely reduced habitat from urban development. The species now live in just 7% of their historical habitat range, with fewer than 2,000 individuals left in the wild. In a densely populated country like India, human-wildlife conflict is also a contributing factor to its dwindling numbers. </p>

          <p>2. Asiatic Lion <br>
            The Asiatic lion is about 10-20% smaller than its African cousins with a larger tail tuft and a distinct belly fold. As the name suggests, the Asiatic Lion was historically native across south-west Asia to eastern India. But now, the species’ entire population can only be found in India and restricted to the Gir National Park and environs in Gujarat. Listed as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) since 2010, the Asiatic lion only has about 500-650 individuals left in the country. While the animal is mostly confined to the Gir Forest, many farmers still use crude and illegal electrical fences to protect their crops where lions often get caught up in it. Likewise, nearly 20,000 open wells dug by farmers in the area for irrigation have led to many accidental drownings of lions.

          <p>3. Snow Leopard <br>
            Much like the Asiatic Lion, snow leopards used to have much larger habitats and prowled across the mountain ranges of Asia. Now, they can only be found in Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and the western and eastern parts of the Himalayas, with population numbers down to about 500 in India. Unsurprisingly, this drop is the result of human interference, namely animal poaching for its pelt and body parts, and a rapid decline of prey due to increasing domestic livestock, which depletes the high altitude pasture lands. Conflicts between remote communities and snow leopards have also been a threat to the species, as well as hydroelectric and mining projects, which reduces the leopard’s natural habitat. As female snow leopards tend to produce only one to two cubs once every two years, it also makes it harder for the species to recover its numbers.

          <p><u>4. One-horned Rhinoceros</u> <br>
            Also known as the Indian rhinoceros, this animal is mostly found in India and the foothills of Himalayas. One-horned rhinoceros has been heavily targeted for their horns for decades, which allegedly have medicinal properties, and killed as agricultural pests. The population is also impacted by frequent flooding seasons, forcing rhinos to move to higher ground and outside of national parks, increasing risks of human-wildlife conflicts. These factors have consequently driven the population to near extinction at the start of the 20th century, dropping down to as little as 200 animals. But with the help of strict and targeted conservation measures, current population numbers have risen back up to around 3,700 in northeastern India and the Terai grasslands of Nepal, making it “one of the most successful conservation efforts in history”.
